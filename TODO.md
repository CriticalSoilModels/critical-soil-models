# TODO

1) Pull the associative mohr-coulomb model into this repo and figure out what it's problem is.
   1) Use this to learn more about the types that should be used and how the constitutive relations can be generalized
   2) Use this to test the incremental-driver and fumat workflow
   3) Set up a testing framework that can be mapped onto the other constitutive relations
   4) Set up CI/CD testing

2) 

3) Pull the strain softening mohr-coloumb model in here
   1) Write tests where possible for the procedures and subroutines
   2) Modernize the implementation

4) Pull the CamClay model in here
   1) Use the tested invariant library
   2)
